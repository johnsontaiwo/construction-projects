# README

This web application is made after the model of a construction industry agency that uses technology to track their projects and contractors.

To use this app, you must clone it into your local system and start rails server. 

For a starter, a user must first sign up as an ordinary user before they can be signed up as a contractor by the Administrator.

A signed-in user can see the list of all the agency's on-going projects but they can't perform any action on them.

A signed-in user, who has been signed-up as a contractor by the Administrator and is working on a list of projects will see the list of all his projects when he logs in but can't perform any action on those projects.

An administrator can perform any action on all the projects and contracctors and users.

As you will see, this app is still in development mode and have a lot of work to be done on it.
